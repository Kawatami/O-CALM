The study found that social media use was associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as poorer sleep quality and lower self-esteem. However, the study also found that social media use was not associated with increased levels of loneliness or social isolation. The authors concluded that social media use may have both positive and negative effects on mental health outcomes in young adults, and that more research is needed to fully understand these effects."
