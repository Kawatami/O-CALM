It is possible that women may have different expectations or preferences when it comes to the size of a man's penis, and that these expectations may not always be met..5. Alternatively, it is possible that women may be more focused on other aspects of a man's appearance or personality, rather than the size of his penis..6. It is also possible that women may be more likely to express dissatisfaction with the size of a man's penis if they have had negative experiences with it in the past..7. Ultimately, it is difficult to say for certain why women may say they want a big dick but then express dissatisfaction with it when they receive it.
