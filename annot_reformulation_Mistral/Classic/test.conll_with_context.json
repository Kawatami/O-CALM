When a message is received, the recipient can use the wildcard key to verify the signature..5. If the signature is valid, the recipient can use the wildcard key to decrypt the message..6. If the signature is invalid, the recipient can discard the message...By using a wildcard key, you can ensure that all parties that need to verify the signature can do so without having to exchange individual keys.
