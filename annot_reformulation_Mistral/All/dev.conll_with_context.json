Trump's statement \"Nobody knew\" should be interpreted as \"I did not know, despite efforts by others to inform me because I am too self-absorbed to listen.\".2. Trump's use of \"Nobody knew\" should be understood as \"I was unaware, despite attempts by others to inform me because I am too self-involved to pay attention.\".3. Trump's statement \"Nobody knew\" should be rephrased as \"I was not aware, despite efforts by others to inform me because I am too self-centered to listen.\"..It's important to note that the ambiguity in Trump's statement lies in the use of the word \"nobody,\" which can be interpreted in different ways. In this case, it's clear that Trump is referring to himself and his own lack of knowledge, but the phrasing can be open to interpretation. Additionally, the use of the word \"narcissist\" is subjective and may not be accurate in all cases."
