It is important to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for the facts, rather than perpetuating misinformation..Regarding your question, there are several reasons why making contraception free and fast-tracking RISUG (Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance) may not be the most effective solution to address population growth..1. Lack of access: While making contraception free may increase accessibility, it is important to consider the logistical challenges of distributing these services in rural or underserved areas. Many communities may not have access to healthcare facilities or trained providers, making it difficult to implement these measures effectively..2. Cultural and social factors: In some cultures or societies, there may be strong taboos or social stigmas surrounding contraception or family planning.
