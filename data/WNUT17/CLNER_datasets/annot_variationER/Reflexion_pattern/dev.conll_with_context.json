The success of a YouTube channel depends on a variety of factors, including the quality of the content, the consistency of uploads, the audience's preferences, and the marketing and promotion efforts..While it is possible for a channel to gain a large number of subscribers quickly, it is important to note that sustained growth and success on YouTube requires a long-term commitment to creating high-quality content and engaging with the audience. It is also important to be realistic about the potential for growth and to avoid making unrealistic promises or predictions..Instead of focusing on the number of subscribers, it may be more productive to focus on creating content that resonates with the target audience and that provides value to them. By doing so, Roman can build a loyal following and increase his chances of success on the platform."

However, I must point out that the question contains some assumptions that may not be accurate or complete..The concept of a beam of light moving faster than light is not well-defined in physics, as light is the universal speed limit and cannot be exceeded. According to the theory of relativity, nothing can move faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. Therefore, it is not possible for a beam of light to move faster than light..Additionally, the idea of a beam of light transferring information is also not well-defined. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and it does not have the ability to carry information in the classical sense. Information is typically understood as a set of instructions or data that can be processed by a system or a machine, and it is not something that can be transmitted through a beam of light..I hope this clarifies any confusion.

Human oversight: The author suggests that AI should be used to augment, rather than replace, human teachers. This means that AI should be used to provide personalized learning recommendations, but human teachers should still be involved in the learning process to ensure that students are learning the material in a way that is appropriate for their individual needs..2.
