Secondly	B-X

As	B-X
a	B-X
linguist	B-X

I	B-X
can	B-X
tell	B-X
you	B-X
that	B-X
creating	B-X
a	B-X
new	B-X
language	B-X
is	B-X
a	B-X
complex	B-X

many	B-X

syntax	B-X

It	B-X
would	B-X
require	B-X
a	B-X
deep	B-X
understanding	B-X
of	B-X
how	B-X
language	B-X
works	B-X

how	B-X
it	B-X

used	B-X
in	B-X

as	B-X

as	B-X
a	B-X
clear	B-X
vision	B-X
for	B-X
what	B-X

how	B-X
it	B-X

be	B-X
used	B-X
.	B-X
.	B-X
Furthermore	B-X
,	B-X
creating	B-X
a	B-X
new	B-X
language	B-X
is	B-X
not	B-X
just	B-X
about	B-X

a	B-X

set	B-X
of	B-X
words	B-X

grammar	B-X
rules	B-X

but	B-X
also	B-X
about	B-X
creating	B-X
a	B-X
new	B-X
cultural	B-X
and	B-X
social	B-X
context	B-X
for	B-X
the	B-X
language	B-X
to	B-X
exist	B-X
in	B-X
.	B-X
It	B-X
would	B-X
require	B-X
a	B-X
community	B-X

speakers	B-X
who	B-X
are	B-X
committed	B-X
