This means that if a beam of light is moving at a speed greater than the speed of light, it cannot carry any information with it..The reason for this is that the speed of light is the maximum speed at which information can travel in the universe, and it is a fundamental limit imposed by the laws of physics. As an object approaches the speed of light, its mass increases and time appears to slow down relative to an observer who is not moving at that speed. This means that the information carried by the object becomes \"stuck\" in the past, and it cannot be transmitted to other observers who are not moving at the same speed..In other words, the information is not actually moving faster than the speed of light, it is just that the observer's perception of time is slowed down relative to the moving object. This means that from the perspective of the moving observer, the information is not actually moving faster than the speed of light, it is"
