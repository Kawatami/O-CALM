The	B-X

argues	B-X
that	B-X

be	B-X
used	B-X

The	B-X

tool	B-X
for	B-X

The	B-X

a	B-X
way	B-X
that	B-X

that	B-X
this	B-X

The	B-X
provided	B-X
text	B-X
is	B-X
a	B-X
good	B-X
start	B-X
,	B-X
but	B-X
there	B-X
are	B-X
several	B-X
areas	B-X
that	B-X
could	B-X
be	B-X
improved	B-X
upon	B-X
.	B-X
Firstly	B-X
,	B-X
the	B-X
use	B-X
of	B-X
passive	B-X
voice	B-X
is	B-X
excessive	B-X
,	B-X
making	B-X
the	B-X
text	B-X
sound	B-X
less	B-X
engaging	B-X
and	B-X
less	B-X
personal	B-X
.	B-X
Additionally	B-X
,	B-X
the	B-X
language	B-X
used	B-X
is	B-X
not	B-X
very	B-X
sophisticated	B-X
,	B-X
which	B-X
may	B-X
not	B-X
be	B-X
suitable	B-X
for	B-X
a	B-X
professional	B-X
audience	B-X
.	B-X
To	B-X
improve	B-X
the	B-X
text	B-X
,	B-X
I	B-X
would	B-X
suggest	B-X
using	B-X
more	B-X
complex	B-X
vocabulary	B-X
and	B-X
sentence	B-X
structures	B-X
,	B-X
as	B-X
well	B-X
as	B-X
varying	B-X
the	B-X
sentence	B-X
structure	B-X
to	B-X
make	B-X
it	B-X
more	B-X
interesting	B-X
and	B-X
dynamic	B-X
.	B-X
Finally	B-X
,	B-X
the	B-X
tone	B-X
of	B-X
the	B-X
text	B-X
could	B-X
be	B-X
more	B-X
consistent	B-X
and	B-X
less	B-X
informal	B-X
,	B-X
as	B-X
it	B-X
currently	B-X
sounds	B-X
a	B-X
bit	B-X
too	B-X
casual	B-X

The	B-X

a	B-X
good	B-X
attempt	B-X

it	B-X
lacks	B-X
clarity	B-X
and	B-X
coherence	B-X
.	B-X
The	B-X
sentences	B-X
are	B-X
short	B-X
and	B-X
simple	B-X
,	B-X
which	B-X
makes	B-X
it	B-X
difficult	B-X
to	B-X
follow	B-X
the	B-X
author	B-X
'	B-X
s	B-X
train	B-X
of	B-X
thought	B-X

Additionally	B-X

make	B-X
them	B-X
clearer	B-X

more	B-X
