happy	B-X

with	B-X
your	B-X

However	B-X
,	B-X
I	B-X
must	B-X
inform	B-X
you	B-X
that	B-X
the	B-X
question	B-X
you	B-X
provided	B-X
contains	B-X
some	B-X
ambiguities	B-X
and	B-X
assumptions	B-X
that	B-X
make	B-X
it	B-X
difficult	B-X
for	B-X
me	B-X
to	B-X
provide	B-X
a	B-X
straightforward	B-X
answer	B-X
.	B-X
.	B-X
Firstly	B-X
,	B-X
the	B-X
term	B-X
"	B-X
linguist	B-X
"	B-X
is	B-X
a	B-X
bit	B-X
broad	B-X
and	B-X
can	B-X
refer	B-X
to	B-X
a	B-X
wide	B-X
range	B-X
of	B-X
professionals	B-X
,	B-X
including	B-X
linguists	B-X
,	B-X
language	B-X
teachers	B-X
,	B-X
and	B-X
language	B-X
learners	B-X
.	B-X
To	B-X
provide	B-X
a	B-X
more	B-X
accurate	B-X
response	B-X
,	B-X
could	B-X
you	B-X
please	B-X
clarify	B-X
which	B-X
type	B-X
of	B-X
linguist	B-X
you	B-X
are	B-X
referring	B-X
to	B-X
?	B-X
.	B-X
Secondly	B-X
,	B-X
the	B-X
question	B-X
assumes	B-X
that	B-X
an	B-X
expert	B-X
linguist	B-X
would	B-X
always	B-X
be	B-X
able	B-X
to	B-X
create	B-X
a	B-X
response	B-X
that	B-X
is	B-X
complete	B-X
and	B-X
accurate	B-X
.	B-X
However	B-X
,	B-X
linguists	B-X
are	B-X
human	B-X
beings	B-X
and	B-X
can	B-X
make	B-X
mistakes	B-X
or	B-X
have	B-X
different	B-X
opinions	B-X
on	B-X
the	B-X
same	B-X
topic	B-X
.	B-X
.	B-X
Lastly	B-X
,	B-X
the	B-X
question	B-X
asks	B-X
for	B-X
the	B-X
output	B-X
of	B-X
an	B-X
expert	B-X
linguist	B-X
,	B-X
but	B-X
it	B-X
'	B-X
s	B-X
not	B-X
clear	B-X
what	B-X
kind	B-X
of	B-X
output	B-X
is	B-X
expected	B-X
.	B-X
Are	B-X

Therefore	B-X
,	B-X
the	B-X
term	B-X

is	B-X
not	B-X
