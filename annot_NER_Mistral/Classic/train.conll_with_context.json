Justice Breyer initially agreed with this argument, but after further consideration, he changed his mind and ruled in favor of the government, stating that the burning of the Koran posed a \"clear and present danger\" to national security...The decision has been controversial, with some arguing that it sets a dangerous precedent for the government to restrict free speech in the name of national security. Others argue that the burning of the Koran is a form of hate speech that should not be protected by the First Amendment."
