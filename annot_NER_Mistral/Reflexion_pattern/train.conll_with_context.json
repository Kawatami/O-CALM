Epix is a premium cable network that offers a variety of movies, TV shows, and original content. Time Warner Cable is a multinational telecommunications company that provides cable television, internet, and phone services...The boycott is due to a deal that Epix made with Netflix, a streaming service that allows users to watch movies and TV shows on demand. Netflix has become increasingly popular in recent years, and many people have started to cancel their cable TV subscriptions in favor of streaming services...The boycott by Time Warner Cable is an attempt to pressure Epix to renegotiate its deal with Netflix. Time Warner Cable argues that the deal is unfair to its customers, who are forced to pay for Epix even if they do not watch it. The company also claims that the deal is hurting its own business, as more people are cancelling their cable TV subscriptions in favor of streaming services...It is worth noting that the boycott by Time Warner Cable is not a legal action, and it is unclear whether it will be successful in forcing Epix to renegotiate its deal"
