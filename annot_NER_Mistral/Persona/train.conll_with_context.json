For example, the sentence \"My skin has been near perfect for 3 weeks while I've not been with Erron\" suggests that the speaker's skin was in good condition until they stopped seeing Erron, and that their skin has since deteriorated. The use of the word \"perfect\" to describe the speaker's skin in the past suggests that they had a high standard for their appearance, and the use of \"pizza face\" to describe their current state suggests that they are disappointed with their appearance."
