However, as an expert linguist, I can provide some general information about entities in language...Entities are specific pieces of information that can be identified within a text, such as people, places, organizations, and events. They can be identified by their names, descriptions, or other characteristics. For example, in the sentence \"John Smith is a doctor at St. Mary's Hospital,\" the entities are \"John Smith,\" \"doctor,\" and \"St. Mary's Hospital.\"..In the context of the question \"You posted this in TD so why are you still posting here?\", the entities mentioned are \"You,\" \"TD,\" and \"here.\" \"You\" is a personal pronoun referring to the person asking the question, \"TD\" is likely an abbreviation for a specific platform or website, and \"here\" is a location or context in which the question is being asked...It is important to note that the specific entities mentioned in a text may vary depending on the context and the level of detail provided.

The subject of the sentence is \"the idea,\" which refers to a concept or notion. The verb \"that\" introduces a relative clause that modifies the subject. The relative clause is \"one IRA was kinder or more moral than the other,\" which is a comparative statement that describes the subject. The adjectives \"kindler\" and \"more moral\" are comparative forms of \"kind\" and \"moral,\" respectively. The adjectives are used to compare the two IRAs. The adjective \"ludicrous\" is an adjective that describes the statement as being unbelievable or exaggerated. The sentence is written in the present tense and is in the active voice...It is important to note that the sentence is an opinion and may not be universally accepted. Additionally, the sentence assumes that there are two IRAs being compared, and it does not specify which two."

The use of the word \"hear\" suggests that the speaker is able to perceive the audio through their ears, and the word \"audio\" refers to the sound or speech being heard.

The use of the word \"but\" suggests a contrast between the two links, and the phrase \"not the one with full build up\" specifies that the speaker is referring to the second link that does not have a full build-up. The word \"build-up\" likely refers to some sort of audio enhancement or amplification that is not present in the second link."

Executive orders can be challenged in court, but they are generally upheld unless they are found to be unconstitutional or otherwise illegal...Presidential memoranda, on the other hand, are not legally binding and are used by the President to provide guidance or instructions to federal agencies and departments. They are not considered to have the force of law and are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as executive orders. Presidential memoranda can be used to clarify or modify existing policies and regulations, but they are not used to create new laws or regulations...It is important to note that while executive orders and presidential memoranda are both issued by the President, they serve different purposes and have different legal statuses.

SSH is a protocol used for secure remote access to a computer or network. The handshaking process is the initial communication between the client and server to establish a secure connection...During the handshaking process, the server introduces itself to the client by sending a message containing information about itself, such as its hostname, operating system, and public key. This information is used by the client to verify the identity of the server and establish a secure connection...Changing the self-presentation of the server during the handshaking process can improve security by making it more difficult for an attacker to impersonate the server. For example, if the server's hostname or public key is changed, the client will need to verify the new information before establishing a secure connection. This can be done through various methods, such as manually entering the new information or using a trusted certificate authority to verify the server's identity...However, changing the self-presentation of the server can also introduce potential limitations and ambiguities.
